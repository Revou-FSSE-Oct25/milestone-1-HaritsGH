            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p><strong>Harits Ghiffari Hanif</strong> is just an ordinary person with a bachelor's degree in Science majoring in Mathematics.
                He likes mathematics since he was in middle school.
                He likes it even more when he attends university.
                He is trying to help people and himself by applying math to real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is a pretty competitive gamer. He enjoys fighting games, especially Under Night In-Birth and Starward, because of how
                rewarding the highly mechanical (precise control) and awareness-demanding gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>
                He can understands code scripts written in Python and SQL.
                His experience with it were creating an automated mouse clicker, a numerical computation with mathematical algorithm, some data analysis, and 
                some basic machine learning implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                His current goal (as of November 2025) is to recreate one of his favorite game, Fight League by XFlag.
                He still struggles on implementing the combat system, with the addition of what programming language to use so it would be light for low-end devices.
