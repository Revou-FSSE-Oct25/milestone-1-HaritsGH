                <h2>Hi, I'm Harits Ghiffari Hanif</h2>
                <p>A budding software engineer who tries to make efficient codes. I love a working system — how everything is collaborating to achieve a common goal.</p>
                <p>I am most curious about understanding how this world is running naturally. Allah's (God's) creation is truly fascinating.</p>
                <p>I may lack in creativity, but I sure do love mechanism. I believe that while senseable impressions are important, the functions are more important.</p>

            <section id="about-me"> 
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm just an ordinary person with a bachelor's degree in Science majoring in Mathematics.
                    I like mathematics since I was in middle school. I like it even more when I attended university.
                    I am hoping to help people and myself by applying math to real-world problems.
                </p>

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I have 1 year of experience programming in Python.
                    So far, I have written Python scripts to do mathematical numerical computation by following the algorithm,
                    analyze data, predict using simple machine learning algorithms, simulate a few game's systems, and
                    create an automation script to ease grinding in a game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am learning to be a Fullstack Software Engineer.
                    My goal is to create apps that will ease people's burdens and to recreate a game that has ended its services.
                </p>

                <h3>Hobbies & Interest</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a pretty competitive gamer. I enjoy fighting games, especially Under Night In-Birth and Starward, because of how
                    rewarding precise control and great awareness feels. I managed to get second place in an online Southeast Asia Under Night In-Birth tournament
                    filled with some of the best SEA players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like animations, especially those with a science fiction genre. Be it 2D or 3D.
                    I love smooth animations, so mesmerizing. Most animations I watched are <i>anime</i>-styled. But some western-styled cartoons are also great.
                </p>

                <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to what I said in <b>Experience</b>, I want to learn Physics so I can make simulations of the real world.
                    I also want to learn other programming language such as Javascript, C, and C++.
                </p>
