# HaritsGH's Web Portofolio

This repo is for my web portofolio that I can share with other people. I'm planning to just use HTML and CSS only for now, while being hosted on Github Pages. I also would like to update it as I learn software engineering and fill it with my completed projects. You can visit it by clicking [here](https://revou-fsse-oct25.github.io/milestone-1-HaritsGH/). (Always be careful when clicking a random link)

## Overview

The website (as of 7 November 2025) is made up by only a homepage. The homepage is made up by these sections:
1. An introduction section to who I am or what kind of a person I am;
2. A section about my experience, interest, and future plans;
3. Links to showcase completed projects; and
4. A way to get in touch with me.

## Implemented Features

As of 7 November 2025, these features have been implemented:
- Navigation at the top of the page to jump to the selected section
- ```Back to top``` button at the bottom of the page

## Technologies Used

For this website, I use:
- HTML
- Github Pages
