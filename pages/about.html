                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Harits Ghiffari Hanif from Indonesia. I like to help people with my problem solving skills. Up until now, it is mostly from analysis that includes numbers and patterns.
                        I'm currently enrolled in RevoU's Fullstack Software Engineer training program to expand my skillset, learning the best practices for web and app development.
                    </p>
        
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        I graduated from Mathematics undergraduate program of Universitas Indonesia.
                        I like math because it helps me decide whether a plan is a realistic one or not.
                        I love a working system(s).
                        I like efficient things.
                        I lack creativity. I struggle at creating an eye-catching design.
                        I believe that while senseable impressions are important, the functions are more valueable.
                        I like people who are also friendly to talk to.
                        I'm trying my best not to be nervous when in the spotlight.
                        I'm a Muslim.
                    </p>
                        
                    <h3>Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have 1 year of experience programming with Python.
                        So far, I have written Python scripts to do mathematical numerical computation by following 
                        the algorithm, analyze data, predict using simple machine learning algorithms, 
                        simulate a few game's systems, and create an automation script to ease grinding in a game.
                        Currently, I am learning to be a Fullstack Software Engineer.
                        My goal is to create apps that will ease people's burdens and to recreate a game that has ended
                        its services.
                    </p>
        
                    <h3>Hobbies & Interest</h3>
                    <p>
                        I like mathematics since I was in middle school. I like it even more when I attended university.
                        I am hoping to help people and myself by applying math to real-world problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like playing video games, competitively and casually.
                        I enjoy fighting games, especially Under Night In-Birth and Starward, because of how
                        rewarding precise control and great awareness feels.
                        I managed to get second place in an online Southeast Asia Under Night In-Birth tournament
                        filled with some of the best SEA players.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also like animations, especially those with a science fiction genre. Be it 2D or 3D.
                        I love smooth animations, so mesmerizing. Most animations I watched are <i>anime</i>-styled. But some western-styled cartoons are also great.
                    </p>
        
                    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                    <p>
                        In addition to what I said in <b>Experience</b>, I want to learn Physics so I can make simulations of the real world.
                        I also want to learn other programming language such as Javascript, C, and C++.
                    </p>
